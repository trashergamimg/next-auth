This section contains guides for common use cases.

If you can't find what you're looking for, [raise an issue](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/new?assignees=&labels=triage%2Cdocumentation&template=4_documentation.yml).

:::warning Warning
Guides are being migrated from the [old documentation page](https://next-auth.js.org), so there are going to be references to `next-auth` still. We are continuously working on updating the naming/references.
